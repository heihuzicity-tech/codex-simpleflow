summary: Record or update project facts (ports, deps, structure)
reads:
  - .specs/project.yml
writes:
  - .specs/project.yml
  - .specs/features/{slug}/sessions/{utc_id}/reports/info-*.md (optional: minimal cheatsheet if enabled)
flow:
  - Detect facts (safe reads) and propose a minimal schema
  - Prompt for additions/edits with a minimal set of items (host/IP, port, service name, and a few core commands)
  - On confirmation, update `.specs/project.yml` under a generic `facts.cheatsheets[]` entry (canonical source) with fields: `key`, `scope`, `updated_at`, and `lines[]` (≤ 10)
  - If `flow.preferences.info.store_reports=true`, also write a short cheatsheet to the active session `reports/` (10–20 lines max, core tips only), otherwise skip
confirmations:
  - Any edits to project.yml
rollback:
  - Atomic write with validation
